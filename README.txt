3D Hurricane Explorer – Quick Start

1) Open index.html in a modern browser (Chrome/Edge/Firefox). You’ll need internet access for live data and map tiles.
2) Use the storm dropdown to select an active storm. If live feeds fail, the app falls back to a small demo.
3) Toggle Globe/Map, scrub the timeline, and switch layers (cone, wind radii, arrival time, watches/warnings).
4) Florida Impacts panel summarizes the "Most Likely Arrival Time of Tropical Storm Force Winds" for major metros, with action categories:
   - <24h: Act now
   - 24–48h: Prepare
   - 48–72h: Monitor
   - >72h: Low
   (Times derive from NOAA/nowCOAST arrival-time service; durations are approximations. Always follow local officials.)

Notes
- Live data: NHC CurrentStorms.json and NOAA nowCOAST MapServer layers (arrival time, wind radii, warnings). 
- “Record” saves a short WebM screen capture of the current view.
- “Share” copies a link encoding your current view.
- This is an educational prototype; not an official forecast.
